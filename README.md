# CodePress 0.1
A simple blogging template

## Instalation

This app uses [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) as a virtual API Rest server engine to work. Before running this app you must start [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to work.

To install CodePress template, move to appÂ´s root directory and run `npm install` or `npm i`

When you install the app, you must configure the system parameters. You can do it by editing the file `config.js`. If you are going to test the app on a local server, you can use default parameters.

module.exports = {
    serviceURL: process.env.SERVICE_URL || 'http://localhost:',
    servicePORT: process.env.SERVICE_PORT || 3001,
    commentsCollection: process.env.COLLECTION_NAME || 'comments/'
